# WhatsApp Chatbot

This project is a chatbot built using **JavaScript** and **Node.js**, integrated with the **WhatsApp Web API**. The chatbot was created to provide an automated customer service experience, where it sends automatic messages upon recognizing keywords sent by users.

## Features

- The chatbot simulates a **fictional company** for demonstration purposes.
- It **automatically responds** based on the keywords the user sends.
- The user can choose one of the numbered options (from 1 to 5), and the chatbot will respond accordingly.
